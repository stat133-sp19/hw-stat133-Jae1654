"0","#The coefficient of the indicator variable is about -8.35. Which can be used to estimate the baby's weight regards to mother's smoking status. Since the t test shows that the slope is not zero, it says that the mother's moking status affect to baby's weight. Since it has to outcomes which is 1 or 0, we can interpret that if mother was smoking during her pregnancy, the baby's weight drops by 8.348 oz"
