##Ingredients
* Salt
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter     
* 1 pound fresh sweet Italian pork sausages or bulk sausage meat
* 1 large green or Savoy cabbage (2 pounds), cored and thickly shredded
* Freshly ground black pepper
* Crusty bread and coarse mustard

##Speical Kitchen Tools
 - parchment paper for prevention of vegetable discoloration. 

##Cooking Steps
1. Heat oven to 300 degrees, and ring a large pot of salted water to a boil and butter a 9-by-13-by-2-inch baking dish. If using sausages, remove casings and discard them./

2. Place cabbage in boiling water, cover, and let water come back to the boil. Uncover and boil for 3 minutes. Drain cabbage in a colander and run cold water over it to stop cooking. Drain well.

3. Put about 1/3 of the cabbage in buttered dish and cover with 1/2 the meat. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and dot with butter. Repeat, ending with a final layer of cabbage, and dot top with butter.


4. Cover dish tightly with a layer of parchment paper (commenters who skipped the parchment said that their vegetables discolored against the foil), then top with a lid or a layer of aluminum foil. Cook for about 2 1/2 hours, until cabbage is soft and sweet, and top is lightly browned.

5. After 2 hours, uncover the dish

#Euclidean distance 
 
 
<font size="5">Definition</font>  \   \ <font size="2">[Edit]</font>

***********************************************************************
The __Euclidean distance__ between points __p__ and __q__ is the length of the line segment connecting them
$(\overline{\textbf{pq}})$.\

In Cartisian coordinates, if __p__ = ($p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$,..., $p_n$) and __q__ = ($q_1$, $q_2$, $q_3$,..., $q_n$) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from __p__ to __q__, or from __q__ to __p__ is given by the Pythagorean formula

$$
\begin{aligned}
 d(\textbf{p},\textbf{q}) = d(\textbf{q},\textbf{p}) &= \sqrt{(q_1 - p_1)^2 \ + (q_2 - p_2)^2 \ \cdots \ + (q_n - p_n)^2}\\
 &= \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(q_i - p_i)^2}.
\end{aligned}
$$
The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, __p__ and __q__ may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The __Euclidean norm__, or __Euclidean length__, or __magnitude__ of a vector measures the length of the vector.

$\|\textbf{p}\| = \sqrt{(p_1)^2 \ + (p_2)^2 \ + \cdots +(p_n)^2} = \sqrt{\textbf{p}\cdot \textbf{p}},$

where the last expression involves the dot product.
