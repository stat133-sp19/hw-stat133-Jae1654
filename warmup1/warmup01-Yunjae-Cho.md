Ingredients
-----------

-   Salt
-   2 tablespoons unsalted butter
-   1 pound fresh sweet Italian pork sausages or bulk sausage meat
-   1 large green or Savoy cabbage (2 pounds), cored and thickly shredded
-   Freshly ground black pepper
-   Crusty bread and coarse mustard

Speical Kitchen Tools
---------------------

-   parchment paper for prevention of vegetable discoloration.

Cooking Steps
-------------

1.  Heat oven to 300 degrees, and ring a large pot of salted water to a boil and butter a 9-by-13-by-2-inch baking dish. If using sausages, remove casings and discard them./

2.  Place cabbage in boiling water, cover, and let water come back to the boil. Uncover and boil for 3 minutes. Drain cabbage in a colander and run cold water over it to stop cooking. Drain well.

1.  Put about 1/3 of the cabbage in buttered dish and cover with 1/2 the meat. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and dot with butter. Repeat, ending with a final layer of cabbage, and dot top with butter.

2.  Cover dish tightly with a layer of parchment paper (commenters who skipped the parchment said that their vegetables discolored against the foil), then top with a lid or a layer of aluminum foil. Cook for about 2 1/2 hours, until cabbage is soft and sweet, and top is lightly browned.

Euclidean distance
==================

<font size="5">Definition</font>    <font size="2">\[Edit\]</font>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them $(\\overline{\\textbf{pq}})$.
In Cartisian coordinates, if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, *p*<sub>3</sub>,..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, *q*<sub>3</sub>,..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula

$$
\\begin{aligned}
 d(\\textbf{p},\\textbf{q}) = d(\\textbf{q},\\textbf{p}) &= \\sqrt{(q\_1 - p\_1)^2 \\ + (q\_2 - p\_2)^2 \\ \\cdots \\ + (q\_n - p\_n)^2}\\\\
 &= \\sqrt{\\sum\_{i=1}^{n}(q\_i - p\_i)^2}.
\\end{aligned}
$$
 The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector.

$\\|\\textbf{p}\\| = \\sqrt{(p\_1)^2 \\ + (p\_2)^2 \\ + \\cdots +(p\_n)^2} = \\sqrt{\\textbf{p}\\cdot \\textbf{p}},$

where the last expression involves the dot product. *o**v**e**r**l**i**n**e**x*
